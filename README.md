##### NOTE:

I have a custom domain connected to GitHub, so my GitHub Pages repositories 
do not follow the usual GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME-HERE format. 
Instead they follow a "burakyhs.me/REPOSITORY-NAME-HERE" format. 
If the domain fails for some reason, you can still access my site by going to 
[https://burakys.github.io](https://burakys.github.io)
